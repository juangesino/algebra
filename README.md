## 1. Gram-Schmidt

### Introduction

The [Gramâ€“Schmidt process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process) is an algorithm for orthonormalising a set of vectors.

This algorithm uses the canonical [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product) but can be easily modified by changing the dot product defined in the code.

This algorithm uses Ruby, you need to [install ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/es/documentation/installation/) to use it.

:warning:

**This script extends the Array class**. It adds some methods like the dot product, norm and subtraction and it also adds methods for orthogonalising and normalising vectors.

If you really would like to use this script for anything other than educational purposes, create a new class that inherits from Array, but don't extend the Array class like I did!

:warning:

### Usage

After installing Ruby, open the [Interactive Ruby Console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell) by using the command `irb`.

Once in the console you have to load the script:

```ruby
load "gram_schmidt.rb"
```

Now you can call any of the script's methods.

### Examples

Now that you loaded the script, let's use some of the methods.

You can normalize a vector:
```ruby
[1,2,3].normalize
#=> [0.2672612419124244, 0.5345224838248488, 0.8017837257372732]
```

You can find an orthogonal from a vector:
```ruby
[1,2,3].orthogonal([4,5,6])
#=> [1.7142857142857144, 0.4285714285714288, -0.8571428571428568]
```

You can orthogonalize a set of vectors:
```ruby
Array.orthogonals( [ [2,5,4], [1,0,1]  ] )
#=> [[2, 5, 4], [0.7333333333333334, -0.6666666666666666, 0.4666666666666667]]
```

And finally you can orthonormalize a set of vectors using Gram-Schmidt:
```ruby
Array.gram_schmidt( [ [2,5,4], [1,0,1]  ] )
#=> [[0.29814239699997197, 0.7453559924999299, 0.5962847939999439], [0.669438681395203, -0.6085806194501845, 0.42600643361512913]]
```

## 2. Least Squares Method

### Introduction

The [Least Squares Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares) is a method for finding an approximation to incompatible systems.

This algorithm uses Ruby, you need to [install ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/es/documentation/installation/) to use it.

### Usage

After installing Ruby, open the [Interactive Ruby Console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell) by using the command `irb`.

Once in the console you have to load the script:

```ruby
load "least_squares.rb"
```

Now you can call the script's method.

### Example

Now that you loaded the script, let's use the method.

The script has a class `Algebra` which has a class method `least_squares` that you can call, passing as parameters the two matrices `a` and `b` from the system: `a x = b`.

For example, if you have the following set of points:

```
(2; 2)
(3; 4)
(4; 3)
```

This translates to a linear system as:

```
2 = 2 m + b
4 = 3 m + b
3 = 4 m + b
```

In matrix form the system is:

```

| 2 1 |           | 2 |
| 3 1 | . | m | = | 4 |
| 4 1 |   | b |   | 3 |

```

Or

```
a x = b
```

Where `a` and `b` are matrices.

Then we can find the best approximation using the least squares method as follows:

First let's create the `a` matrix using the [Matrix](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.2.0/libdoc/matrix/rdoc/Matrix.html) class from Ruby.
```ruby
a = Matrix[ [2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1] ]
#=> Matrix[[2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1]]
```
Now let's create the `b` matrix:
```ruby
b = Matrix[ [2], [4], [3] ]
#=> Matrix[[2], [4], [3]]
```

Finally, to find the approximation we call the class method:

```ruby
Algebra.least_squares(a, b)
#=> Matrix[[(1/2)], [(3/2)]]
```
So for this example:

```
m = 1/2
b = 3/2
```
